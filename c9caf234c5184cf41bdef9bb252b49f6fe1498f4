Context: Development environment setup for Scheme LLM Toolkit

Considerations:
- Configured for FreeBSD 14.3 with guile3 as the Scheme implementation
- Emacs configuration includes Geiser for REPL integration, paredit for structural editing
- Tmux session management allows persistent development environment
- Environment variables set via both Makefile and .envrc for flexibility
- Support for org-mode documentation and literate programming

Issues addressed:
- Need for consistent development environment across sessions
- Integration of Scheme development tools (Geiser, paredit, rainbow-delimiters)
- Project-specific load paths for Guile modules
- Tmux TTY retrieval for session management

Timing: 2025-08-06
- Implementation completed in single session
- Added core dump file (guile-3.0.core) to untracked files, should be gitignored

Technical details:
- Emacs started with -Q flag for clean initialization, then loads project config
- Tmux session named after project for easy identification
- GUILE_LOAD_PATH configured for src directory access
- Helper functions for test running and provider loading included
