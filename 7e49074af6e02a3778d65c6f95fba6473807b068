0.1.0 Release Preparation - Comprehensive Review and Cleanup

THOUGHT PROCESS:
- Conducted systematic review of entire codebase for release readiness
- Identified and prioritized critical issues vs nice-to-have improvements
- Focused on stability, documentation quality, and user experience
- Applied conventional commit standards throughout cleanup process

DEBUGGING AND ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
1. Shebang Syntax Errors:
   - Found malformed `#\!/usr/bin/env guile3\n\!#` blocks in multiple files
   - Caused "unterminated comment" compilation errors
   - Fixed by removing malformed blocks and using proper Scheme syntax
   - Affected: check.scm, test-json.scm, test-provider.scm, and others

2. Segmentation Fault Investigation:
   - HTTP/provider integration causes segfaults during compilation
   - Appears related to curl subprocess handling or JSON processing
   - Core functionality works when run without compilation
   - Identified as critical issue for release (marked in CHANGELOG)

3. FreeBSD Compatibility:
   - guile-json auto-installation fails on FreeBSD
   - Manual installation required and documented
   - Proper shebang usage for guile3 compatibility confirmed

CLEANUP PERFORMED:
- Fixed all syntax errors preventing test execution
- Removed generated core dump files
- Standardized all experiment scripts to use proper Scheme syntax
- Updated documentation with accurate quick start guide
- Added comprehensive system requirements and installation notes

TECHNICAL DECISIONS:
1. Version Management: Added VERSION file for semantic versioning
2. Documentation Strategy:
   - Maintained existing README.org format
   - Added comprehensive CHANGELOG.md
   - Focused on working examples over theoretical descriptions
3. Release Strategy:
   - Documented known issues rather than hiding them
   - Provided clear workarounds for identified problems
   - Prioritized transparency for developers

SECURITY REVIEW FINDINGS:
- HTTP client implementation is secure (no shell injection vulnerabilities)
- Temporary file handling uses proper cleanup with dynamic-wind
- JSON escaping implemented correctly
- No obvious security issues in provider abstraction layer

TEST RESULTS SUMMARY:
✅ Dependencies: All required modules available on FreeBSD/Guile 3.0.10
✅ JSON Processing: Generation, parsing, and roundtrip conversion working
✅ Build System: All Makefile targets functional with proper error handling
⚠️ Provider Integration: Core functionality works, segfault in complex scenarios
⚠️ HTTP Client: Basic operations work, stability issues under load

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS IDENTIFIED:
1. Resolve segmentation fault in provider integration
2. Add integration tests that don't require external services
3. Implement additional provider backends (OpenAI, Anthropic)
4. Add performance benchmarks for JSON and HTTP operations
5. Consider CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

RELEASE READINESS ASSESSMENT:
- Core functionality: READY
- Documentation: EXCELLENT
- Build system: READY
- Test coverage: ADEQUATE with known limitations
- Security: REVIEWED and ACCEPTABLE
- Stability: NEEDS WORK (segfault issue)

RECOMMENDATION:
Ready for 0.1.0-alpha release with documented known issues.
Full 0.1.0 release pending segfault resolution.
